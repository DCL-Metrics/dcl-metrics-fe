We are thrilled to share that one of our developers, Dax, was recently invited
by the team at [unversed](https://unversed.org) to discuss the past, present and
future of DCL-Metrics and Decentraland. We were honored to be recognized by the community
and are proud to announce that our software was awarded second place for the [software
of the year in unversed's awards ceremony](https://unversed.org/dcl-awards-first/software-of-the-year/)!
