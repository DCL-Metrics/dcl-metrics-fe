## Introduction

Firstly, I'd like to thank everyone who took part in the voting and discussion, everyone who has messaged me with feedback or ideas and the DAO for making this opportunity possible.

<br />
Since our grant was approved, we've been busy adding a lot of behind the scenes changes
for platform stability and data integrity.

<br />
Our first major release on 2022-09-09 made the last 90 days of global statistics
available with an updated UI and more easy-to-understand data breakdowns.

## Highlights

#### TL;DR: we've solidified our roadmap and closed 43 tickets in the last month, pertaining mainly to platform stability.

Our user-facing changelog is available at [https://www.dcl-metrics.com/roadmap](https://www.dcl-metrics.com/roadmap).

<br />

Before submitting our grant proposal, JW and I worked hard and fast to put together an MVP to showcase what we could do -
I believe we accomplished that well but after the grant was approved **we knew we had to spend some time refactoring**.
That includes things like the following:

<br />

- Error handling and tracking
- Cleaning up MVP code for long-term maintenance and adding more automated tests
- Building staging pipelines to test new code before production deployment
- Internal metrics and notifications so we are aware if something breaks
- HTTPS everywhere
- Aggressive caching to keep resource usage in check and provide fast loading times
- Locked API access to prevent malicious D/DOS attacks on our server

<br />
We have spent some time on **user-facing** features as well. These include:
<br />

- Adding new components to the global dashboard
- Roadmap / Changelog so users can see where we are and what is coming next
- Expanded data range (up to 90 days)
- Updated user data formatting

<br />

## Blockers

Our main blocker in the past month was the uncertainty re: the catalyst endpoints from which we pull our data - if the `/comms/peers` endpoint
was deprecated completely, would it still make sense to continue? What data would we show? Could we find that data from other sources?

<br />
Unfortunately this took quite a lot of bandwidth, however I feel relatively confident
that the issue will be sorted out over a long enough time frame that even in the
worst case scenario we will have time to adapt and continue providing useful data
to the community.

## Next steps

Our immediate next concern is showing scene-based metrics. We have already begun pulling tickets related to this and our goal is to have this implemented in production by mid-October 2022.

<br />
After that we will implement a land-picker tool which will open up the possibility
of displaying metrics for all parcels and scenes, not just "top 10" lists. We have
already done some ideation and research work in this direction.

<br />
Beyond that we want to provide more rich daily stats such as daily/weekly/monthly
average users, concurrent users and traffic histograms globally and by scene Additional
notes and links

## Additional notes and links

We're seeing relatively steady traffic, but haven't been pushing the site very hard
in terms of sharing links or making announcements. You can see spikes in traffic
around the time that our grant was approved and yesterday (09 September) when we
announced our first major update.

<br />
The usage breakdown is also relatively as expected with the majority of users using
Chrome on either desktop or laptop. I am somewhat surprised that linux is the second
most represented OS, but that is somewhat skewed because JW and I both use linux
and check the site at least once a day :D

Thank you once again to the DAO for the opportunity to build this project! If you
have any questions, feedback, feature requests or just want to say hi, please feel
free to contact me in the discord!
