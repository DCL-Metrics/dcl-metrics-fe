## Introduction

This month had an unexpected requirement - our database was reaching capacity, so we needed to create a way to archive the data within a strict deadline. We achieved this, but it took away some time from our expected development timeline!

Nevertheless we were able to start working on a draft of user profiles and clean up some code in both backend and frontend repos.

## Highlights

### Completed

#### Backend

- implement pulling of dao transparency data
- add internal api endpoints for pulling user data
- archive data points (urgent db requirement)
- update max concurrent users calculation
- create user statistics for every user, every day

#### Frontend

- update chart labeling for better readability
- refactor server side fetching and fix tiles.json fetch error
- add average markers to charts
- cleanup linechart component and add settings menu
- add api docs to FE
- work on top land components with data from MGH DAO (currently unused)
- add user feedback to settings menu
- work on user profiles dashboard

## Blockers

No blockers, but data archival was a speedbump!

## Next steps

Next steps are to release a v1 of user profiles for every user!
