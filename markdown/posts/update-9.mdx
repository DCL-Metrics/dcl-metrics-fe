## Introduction

One of the first bar-napkin sketches I made when planning out DCL-Metrics was
a screen with in-depth details about users and their interactions within the DCL
ecosystem. This month, we're very excited to announce that this feature has been
deployed and is already being used by DCL citizens! You check it out by adding
your ethereum address (`0x...`) to this url: dcl-metrics.com/users/ADDRESS

<br />
For example: dcl-metrics.com/users/0x0506d39effcaefbc632cbe72c36c4d64759a665f

## Highlights

### Completed

#### Backend

- add user activity queries
- fix bugs in reporting DAO delegators
- migrate scenes data to primary database for faster queries
- ensure all scenes are linkable by returning scene UUIDs in all related responses
- when no recent data exists for a scene, return last existing data (grants
  historic access to no longer deployed scenes)

#### Frontend

- link scenes from all components
- implement user profile pages
- a lot of testing, fixing and polishing
- update size and styling of various components
- adjustments for historic scene access
- end-to-end testing


## Blockers

No blockers!

## Next steps

Next steps are various small fixes and refactoring on backend, testing on
frontend and finishing our proposed roadmap!
