## Introduction

This has been a big month for DCL-metrics as we've had literally thousands of new
users and have found ourselves at the center of the conversation of how Decentraland
is used. The time we spent last month hardening the server and making sure the site
was able to handle more traffic was indeed well spent!

<br />
We've also been busy with a redesign and updates related to scene metrics including
a global metric of scenes visited per day as well as top scene metrics.

## Highlights

The biggest update has been scene data - we are now showing the total number of scenes
visited per day as a global metric as well as the following metrics for the top five
scenes per category:

<br />

- most unique visitors
- avg time spent
- avg time spent AFK
- most logins
- most logouts

<br />
There is another scene component on the way which should be deployed within the next
week - that one is a deeper dive of the top ten scenes every day and a template for
what scene pages will look like when data is available for all scenes.

<br />
We have also done a small redesign together with a UX expert to make the page easier
to access and navigate as well as splitting it up by global data, users, scenes and
parcels.

## Blockers

The biggest blocker is that I was away for the majority of the month and that definitely
slowed down progress - JW and I planned for this as much as was possible and I completed
a lot of backend work before leaving so he would not be blocked.

## Next steps

Our next step is to deploy a more complex scene component as mentioned above, followed
by a simple status page to reflect the quality of the data we pull each day.

<br />
After that we will focus on making data available for all users/parcels/scenes instead
of just top lists and introduce more advanced user metrics such as unique and average
user counts across each time frame.

## Additional notes and links

Here are the internal metrics about the site in the last 30 days. You can see there
is a huge increase in traffic from last month's update as well as a lot of referrals.
