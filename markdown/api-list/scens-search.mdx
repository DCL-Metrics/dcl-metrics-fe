# GET /scenes/search

Search for scenes by name or coordinates. This endpoint returns the first 10
results for a given query.

## API ENDPOINT

### `https://api.dcl-metrics.com/scenes/search`

## QUERY PARAMS

- **name**: The name of the scene you're searching for. Case-sensitive! Ex: `Genesis`
- **coordinates**: Coordinates of the scene you're search for. Ex: `1,-1`

Queries can be combined, such as search for scenes with names containing `Ice`
at coordiates `-101,128`. The results will be better if you only search for one
coordinate at a time (ie, not multiple coordinates)

### ex: `https://api.dcl-metrics.com/scenes/search?name=ICE%20Poker&coordinates=-101,128`

#### SAMPLE DATA

The expected response, as json:

```json
[
  {
    "name":"ICE Poker - The Stronghold",
    "first_seen_at": null // this occurs on scenes that were deployed before we started tracking scenes
    "coordinates": "-100,126;-100,127;-100,128;-100,129;-101,126;-101,127;-101,128;-101,129;-102,126;-102,127;-102,128;-102,129;-99,126;-99,127;-99,128;-99,129",
    "uuid": "6c3717aa-b658-4ece-8ae0-84d3d9f24d3b"
  },
  {
    // additional scenes
  }
]
```
