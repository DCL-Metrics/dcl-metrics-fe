# API Basics

This document shows how to make calls to api.dcl-metrics.com

## API Key

API keys are currently only on a test basis, so there is no automated way to
request one at the present time. API keys are given in [UUID format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) and
have both an expiration date and permissions associated with them.

## How to call

Assuming your API key is `eb759b1d-8060-4d76-9e38-384103dccf15`, you would call
the API like this:

```bash
curl -H "API_KEY: eb759b1d-8060-4d76-9e38-384103dccf15" \
"https://api.dcl-metrics.com/scenes/search?name=ICE%20Poker&coordinates=-101,128"
```
