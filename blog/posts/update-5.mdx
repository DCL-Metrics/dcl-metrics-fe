## Introduction

This update isn't as sexy as previous ones as there's not much in the way of new
features - the majority of this month was spent refactoring, fixing bugs and preparing
to open source the project, which will likely be done by the time you read this ðŸ˜„

## Highlights

## Blockers

No real blockers this month - it would be good to have more hands, but we'll address
that soon! With the project now being open source we will begin to seek out contributors.

## Next steps

### Next in the pipeline

We've scheduled a planning meeting this week to discuss what comes next. Part of
that meeting will also include the initial creation of a user feedback form inspired
by a design perspective meeting we had this past month.

<br />
We hope to start user feedback sessions within the month, this will likely effect
our planned roadmap somewhat as we will focus on what users tell us they use / would
like to use, but the current plan of next things to work on are:

<br />

- deeper scene metrics for all scenes on the map
- user lookup and user data pages (design and initial work)
- sales and rentals data, now that the rental contract has been released for DCL
