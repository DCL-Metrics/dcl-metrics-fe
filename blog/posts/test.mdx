# Introduction

Markdown and Mdx parsing is supported via `unified`, and other remark and rehype packages. `next-mdx-remote` allows us to parse `.mdx` and `.md` files in a more flexible manner without touching webpack.

GitHub flavored markdown is used. `mdx-prism` provides syntax highlighting capabilities for code blocks. Here's a demo of how everything looks.

The following markdown cheatsheet is adapted from: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

## Lists

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
