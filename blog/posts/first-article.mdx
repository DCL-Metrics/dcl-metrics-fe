# Hello! Bonjour! こんにちは! 안녕하세요!

Welcome to our newly opened DCL-Metrics dev blog! We're excited to use this platform to share our experiences and insights as software developers/user of Decentraland.
Here at DCL-Metrics, we're a team of passionate two developers who are always looking for ways to improve our craft and share the information to our users.
Through this blog, we hope to share our experiences with fellow users and anyone else who's interested in the world of Decentraland.

### What We'll Cover

We'll be covering a wide range of topics of Decentraland mainly for the moment. We'll also be sharing some of our own feature development journey and experiences, as well as some tips and tricks worth sharing we've learned along the way.

### Why We're Doing This

We believe that by sharing our data and knowledge, we can help users grow and improve their experiences.
We also hope that this blog will be a place where developers can come together to share their own ideas and experiences,
and engage in meaningful discussions about the field of software development. [Contribution](https://github.com/DCL-Metrics?type=source) is always welcomed!

### Get in Touch

We're looking forward to starting this new journey with all of you, and we hope that you'll find our blog to be informative, helpful, and entertaining.
If you have any suggestions for topics you'd like us to cover, or if you just want to say hello, feel free to send an email (dcl.metrics@gmail.com) or get in touch with us directly.
