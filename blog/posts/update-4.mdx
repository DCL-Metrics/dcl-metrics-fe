## Introduction

This has been another good month for us! We were able to ship a v1 of our scene map
which gives basic stats about all parcels in the world and sets the stage for a lot
of cool new features in the next months. We also took care of some bug fixes and
handled a few other roadmap items, such as switching our data consumption away from
the catalyst network and onto Atlas Corp's data warehouse.

## Highlights

### Completed:

#### backend:

- start pulling user data as well as building records of dcl nfts held by the user
- start tracking `max_concurrent_users` per parcel
- tighten up SQL queries for better performance
- update job processing to allow for updating data multiple times per day
- enhance user activity and parcel traffic calculations for greater metrics accuracy
- switch to pulling data from atlas corp

#### frontend:

- add 'jump-in' functionality to scene component
- work on dashboards feature (preparation for displaying data about any scene)
- build land picker (scene map) component using [tiles-map](https://github.com/decentraland/tile-map)
- general UI improvements
- develop heatmap feature for scene map
- error handling updates

## Blockers

Jongwoo and I (and most of Europe) have been sick on and off this month and it's
definitely slowed us down a bit - mitigation strategy: vitamin c?

## Next steps

### Next in the pipeline:

- adding daily new users (plus additional user data!) to the global user stats (EOY)
- refactoring both the frontend and backend
- open sourcing the code in early Q1 2023
- stability and performance improvements
- updates to the scene map for quality and additional features
- user profiles (nft data, dao data, user specific stats)
