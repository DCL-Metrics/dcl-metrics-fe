# Introduction

Markdown and Mdx parsing is supported via `unified`, and other remark and rehype packages.
`next-mdx-remote` allows us to parse `.mdx` and `.md` files in a more flexible manner without touching webpack.
GitHub flavored markdown is used. `mdx-prism` provides syntax highlighting capabilities for code blocks. Here's a demo of how everything looks.
The following markdown cheatsheet is adapted from: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

&nbsp;

| First Header | Second Header                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| cell 1       | Content from cell 2          |
| first column | Content in the second column |

&nbsp;

{/* TODO add syntax highlighting */}

```js
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({ params: { slug: post.slug } }))
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  }
}
```
